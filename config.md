    Circuitscape is an award-winning connectivity analysis software package which borrows algorithms from electronic circuit theory to predict patterns of movement, gene flow, and genetic differentiation among plant and animal populations in heterogeneous landscapes.
    Circuitscape has rapidly become the most widely used connectivity analysis package in the world.
    It is used by numerous state, federal, and local agencies in the USA, and by government ministries and NGOs for conservation planning on six continents.
    It routinely appears in journals like PNAS, Nature Genetics, Ecology, Ecological Applications, Ecology Letters, Landscape Ecology, Evolution, Heredity, Bioscience, Molecular Ecology, Conservation Biology, and many others
