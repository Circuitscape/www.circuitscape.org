## Older releases

The [Circuitscape.py](https://github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape.py/) project is archived on Github. Circuitscape v4.0.5 installers are still available for download:

### WINDOWS:

* [**64-bit Windows executable**](https://circuitscapebinaries.blob.core.windows.net/binaries/Circuitscape-4.0.5-x64-setup.exe). Most PC users will want this version. See our [FAQ](http://www.circuitscape.org/FAQ) about working with large grids.
* [**32-bit Windows executable**](https://circuitscapebinaries.blob.core.windows.net/binaries/Circuitscape-4.0.3-Win32-setup.exe). (v4.0.3- update coming soon). For older PCs running 32-bit Windows.
* [**Circuitscape ArcGIS toolbox**](https://circuitscapebinaries.blob.core.windows.net/binaries/Circuitscape_for_ArcGIS_2013_10_08_rev2.zip). Calls Circuitscape from ArcMap (requires ArcGIS 10.0 or newer, and Circuitscape must be installed).
* [**Gnarly Landscape Utilities**](https://circuitscapebinaries.blob.core.windows.net/binaries/Gnarly_Landscape_Utilities_0_1_9.zip). An ArcGIS toolbox that creates resistance and core areas needed by Circuitscape.
* [**Linkage Mapper**](https://circuitscape.org/linkagemapper/). An ArcGIS toolbox that uses least-cost corridor methods and Circuitscape to support regional connectivity analyses.

### MAC OS X:

* [Mac executable](https://circuitscapebinaries.blob.core.windows.net/binaries/Circuitscape-4.0.5.dmg). For Macs using OS X 10.9 or later. Youâ€™ll want to get the [examples directory](https://github.com/Circuitscape/Circuitscape/tree/master/examples) too.

### Linux:

* Python source code as a [Python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Circuitscape/).
